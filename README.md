# Adult Census Income Analysis

This repository contains an **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** of the **Adult Census dataset** using **R**. The main objective is to understand which factors influence an individual's income, particularly whether it exceeds $50,000 per year.

## Project Structure

- `notebooks/R.ipynb` – The main R notebook containing all code for data cleaning, EDA, and visualizations.  
- `data/` – Directory for the dataset.  
- `README.md` – Overview of the project and instructions.  

## Dataset Overview

The analysis uses the **Adult Census dataset** from [Kaggle]([https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/adult-census-income/data)). This dataset includes **demographic and employment data** from the 1994 US Census, with **over 30,000 records** and **14 attributes** such as age, education, occupation, and marital status.

## Analysis Highlights

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handled missing or inconsistent values.  
   - Ensured overall data integrity for accurate analysis.  

2. **Descriptive Statistics**  
   - Summarized key variables using measures like mean, median, and standard deviation.  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Created visualizations (bar plots, histograms, etc.) to explore relationships between variables and income.  
   - Identified patterns and trends that influence high-income earners.  

4. **Inferential Statistics**  
   - Performed tests to determine relationships between categorical variables (e.g., Chi-Squared tests).
     
## How to View the Analysis

- You can view the full analysis in the **R notebook**: `notebooks/R.ipynb`.  
- To run it locally or in the cloud, open the notebook in **RStudio** or **Google Colab** with R support.
